                        <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
                        <p>Ducks on Fire is a creative digital media agency. While my teammates focused on creating the branding guide, game and logo designs, I was responsible for researching, designing, and developing the agency's website. The project involved creating a professional web presence that accurately represents our creative agency brand and showcases our services to potential clients.</p>

                            <p>I started by looking at different creative digital agencies to see what works well. This helped me understand what makes a good agency website and how to make Ducks on Fire stand out from other creative companies.</p>

                            <p>I checked out many agency websites to see what they all do the same and what makes some special. This helped me learn what clients want to see when they visit a creative agency's website and how to show our services clearly.</p>

                            <h3>INSPIRATION GATHERING</h3>
                            <p>After finishing my research, I collected visual ideas from top creative agencies. I looked for websites that show creative work well while still looking professional. This helped me figure out what design style would work best for Ducks on Fire's brand.</p>

                            <p>The inspiration I found helped me decide on layout, fonts, colors, and how to organize content. I made sure to collect different examples that could help with various parts of the website design.</p>

                            <p>Using Figma, I made different design versions for the Ducks on Fire website. I took the brand guide my teammates created and turned it into a website that shows what our agency can do.</p>

                            <h3>MULTIPLE DESIGN ITERATIONS</h3>
                            <p>I made several different design ideas in Figma, trying out different ways to show our agency's services and work. Making these different versions let me test various layouts and styles before picking the final design.</p>

                            <p>Each new design was better than the last one because I used feedback to make improvements. This way of working step by step made sure the final design looks good and works well.</p>

                            <p>To check if my designs worked well, I showed them to my teammates, classmates, and friends to get their opinions. Getting feedback was really important to find problems and make sure the website clearly shows what our agency offers.</p>

                            <p>I showed people my different design versions and asked what they thought about how it looks, if the information was clear, and if it was easy to use. I asked specific questions about moving around the site, how information was organized, and what they thought of the brand.</p>

                            <h3>FEEDBACK INTEGRATION</h3>
                            <p>Using the feedback I got, I made smart changes to create the final design. The testing showed me important things about what users expect and helped me improve the website's layout and look to better serve the people we want to reach.</p>

                            <p>The feedback also helped make sure the website matched the brand guide my teammates made, keeping everything consistent across all Ducks on Fire materials.</p>

                            <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>
                            <p>After using all the feedback and trying many different design ideas, I created the final design that best shows the Ducks on Fire brand. The final design mixes creativity with professional features, making an interesting experience that clearly shows what our agency can do.</p>

                            <p>During the whole design process, I worked closely with the brand guide my teammates made to keep everything looking the same. This meant using the right colors, fonts, and visual parts that show the Ducks on Fire brand.</p>

                            <p>The design shows our agency's brand online, displaying our creative skills while following the brand rules and keeping the professional quality that shows our team's work together.</p>

                            <p>After finishing the design in Figma, I built the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code. The development part meant turning the visual designs into a working website that works on different devices and browsers.</p>

                            <p>I focused on creating clean HTML structure, good CSS styling, and interactive JavaScript features that make the website better to use. The coding process needed careful attention to make sure the final website looked exactly like the Figma designs.</p>

                            <h3>VERSION CONTROL</h3>
                            <p>I used GitHub to manage all the code changes during development, making sure everything was tracked and documented properly. This helped me keep a clear history of the development and work with my team when needed.</p>

                            <p>Regular commits with clear messages helped me track progress and gave me the option to undo changes if needed. The GitHub repository keeps a complete record of the website's development from start to finish.</p>

                            <p>We started this project by creating a team charter that set clear rules and expectations for how we would work together. This helped us understand everyone's roles and how we would communicate during the project.</p>

                            <p>For task management, we use Flowspace, which works like Trello. We split up all our tasks there and put important project information that everyone needs to see. This keeps us organized and makes sure nothing gets forgotten.</p>

                            <p>Our daily communication happens through WhatsApp where we share quick updates, ask questions, and coordinate our work. This keeps everyone in the loop about what's happening with the project.</p>
